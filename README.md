# Image Upload Frontend Using React (WIP)

### Overview

This image upload frontend is part two of my Ascii Art Project.

Using React, I made a simple image upload frontend that connects with my backend server. The image is processed by the server and returns the uploaded image as an ascii art image.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code - IDE
- React app
- Axios - Used to talk with the server (instead of fetch())

## How to run it (on Windows)

In the command prompt or terminal, go to the directory where the React image-upload-project is saved:
```
$ cd image-upload-project
```

In the project directory, run the react app:

```
$ npm start
```

It will run the app in development mode.

A new tab in your browser should automatically open with the image upload front end. If it does not, enter http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Connect to backend server
